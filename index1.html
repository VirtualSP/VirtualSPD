    <p>WebAudio Virtual Speakers System (WVS)
</p>
    <p>Using headphones or earphones, you feel the sound comes from just close to your ears or from the center of the head. It's quite different from the sound in the audio room with speakers. WVS converts your favorite music to Binaural 3D sound and plays in natural audio space with headphones or earphones.
</p>
    <p>Supported audio codec is FLAC, WAV, MP3, OGG, and requires a PC supported WebAudio.
